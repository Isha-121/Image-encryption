						Rosalind Elsie Franklin, born in London 1920, was a crystallographer
						and chemist involved in several crystallography projects. After
						obtaining her PhD at Cambridgde University in 1945 and developing
						proficiency in carbon X-ray crystallography in Paris, Dr. Franklin
						joined the ranks of the King's College in London to study DNA. Even
						though not getting along with her new colleague Maurice Wilkins,
						progress was made and the famous Photograph 51 - capturing the
						helical structure of DNA - was taken by Dr. Franklin.<br /><br />Both
						the image and other data of Franklin's research made its way to
						Watson and Crick, who used the data (jovially referred to by
						themselves as "burglary") to gain insight into and publish an
						article about the structure of DNA. Dr. Franklin left to join
						Birkbeck's college, where she excelled in studying the structure of
						the tobacco mosaic virus and was a recognized expert in her field.
						<br /><br />
						At the age of just 38, Dr. Rosalind Elsie Franklin died of ovarian
						cancer. Several years later, Watson, Crick and Wilkins were awarded
						a Nobel prize for discovering the helical structure of DNA. Upon the
						rise of the feminist movement, this sparked the asking of the

							>Rosalind Franklin question</a
						>
						at every presentation of Watson, followed by applause. Although Dr.
						Franklin was not recognized with a Nobel prize, she is now
						remembered in a multitude of ways including, but not limited to,
						science institutes, awards, prizes and even a rocket planned to
						launch in 2022.
