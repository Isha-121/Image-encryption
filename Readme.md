# Image Encryption/Decryption Using DNA Cryptography
<p>Image encryption is an essential process for securing digital images transmitted over unsecured networks. One promising approach to image encryption is DNA cryptography, which uses DNA molecules as a basis for encoding and decoding secret messages. DNA-based encryption provides several advantages, including high information density, resistance to brute-force attacks, and an inherent ability to self-replicate.</p>

<p>One of the major challenges in image encryption using DNA cryptography is the size of the DNA sequences required to encode images. Since DNA sequences are limited in length, it may be necessary to split large images into smaller sections and encode each section separately. Additionally, since DNA molecules can be affected by environmental factors such as heat and radiation, it is essential to develop methods for stabilizing and storing DNA-based encryption keys.
</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, image encryption using DNA cryptography shows great promise as a highly secure and efficient method of encrypting digital images. Future research in this area may focus on developing more efficient DNA-based encryption algorithms and improving the stability and storage of DNA molecules. </p>
